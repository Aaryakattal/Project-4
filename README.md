# Project-4
The first image features a maze border made of chocolate bars, creating a distinct frame for the level. The second image displays a pixel-art cat sprite with clean lines and a limited color palette. The third image is a cave-themed background with gray rock tiles and contrasting purple orbs, adding both visual depth and gameplay elements.

I imported all three assets into Unity as PNG files, ensuring they were clean and free of padding. Using the Tilemap system, I constructed the maze and positioned the cat sprite on the map, ensuring that all elements fit together properly in the scene.
